# Unpaid Labor by Women

This idea of this project is to go through this data collected by 'The World Bank' and look at how bad it really is out there for us ladies. 

The definition of 'unpaid labor', from the website below, includes but isn't limited to <i>'domestic and care work includes food preparation, dishwashing, cleaning and upkeep of a dwelling, laundry, ironing, gardening, caring for pets, shopping, installation, servicing and repair of personal and household goods, childcare, and care of the sick, elderly or disabled household members, among others'</i>.
